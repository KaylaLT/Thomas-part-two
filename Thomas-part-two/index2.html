    <h1>Crop Yield Calculator</h1>
    <h2>Normally the land produces 50 bushles of grain</h2>
    <p>
      I have created this site to calulate the yield based on factors given. The
      yield is affected by the rain, whether fertilizer is used or not, and if
      the fertiziler is used it is adjusted by type of ferterlizer. The console
      should show yield calculations based on users answers to the prompts.
      Acess the console and watch it work.
